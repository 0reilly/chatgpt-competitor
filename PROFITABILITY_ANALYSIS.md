# Profitability Analysis

## Business Model Overview

This ChatGPT competitor is designed to be profitable by:

1. **Cost-Based Pricing**: Charging users based on actual API costs plus a profit margin
2. **Tiered Subscriptions**: Offering different usage levels at different price points
3. **Usage Monitoring**: Enforcing limits and preventing abuse
4. **Scalable Architecture**: Low operational costs with serverless-friendly design

## Cost Structure

### Direct Costs (DeepSeek API)
- **Input tokens**: $0.001 per 1,000 tokens
- **Output tokens**: $0.002 per 1,000 tokens

### Example Cost Calculation
```

```

## Growth Projections

### Conservative Estimate
- **Month 1**: 10 free users, 2 pro users
- **Month 3**: 50 free users, 10 pro users, 1 enterprise
- **Month 6**: 200 free users, 25 pro users, 5 enterprise

### Revenue Projection
```
Month 1: 2 * $9.99 = $19.98
Month 3: 10 * $9.99 + 1 * $49.99 = $149.89
Month 6: 25 * $9.99 + 5 * $49.99 = $499.70
```

### Profit Projection
```
Month 1: $19.98 - $40 = -$20.02 (loss)
Month 3: $149.89 - $40 = $109.89 profit
Month 6: $499.70 - $40 = $459.70 profit
```
